## Note : 
1. In the context of the 8051 microcontroller assembly language, the "@" symbol is used to denote indirection. When "@" is used before a register or memory operand, it signifies that the instruction should access the memory location pointed to by the value of that register or memory location.

# Intel 8051 Microcontroller Architecture Overview


### CPU Core
- 8-bit CPU with a modified Harvard architecture.


### Registers

- Accumulator (A)
- B Register (B)
- Data Pointer (DPTR)
- Program Counter (PC)
- Stack Pointer (SP)
- Status Register (PSW)
- **R Registers (R0-R7):**  
  The "R" registers, also known as Register Banks, provide additional general-purpose storage for temporary variables and data during program execution.
- **B Register (Bank 1 Register):**  
  The B register (R1) is an 8-bit general-purpose register used for various arithmetic and logic operations.


### Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)
- Performs arithmetic and logic operations.

### Memory
- 8-bit data bus and 16-bit address bus.
- Supports up to 64KB of external data memory and 64KB of external program memory.

### Timers/Counters
- Four 16-bit timers/counters (Timer 0, Timer 1, Timer 2, Timer 3).

### Interrupts
- Supports five interrupt sources: External, Timer 0, Timer 1, Timer 2, and Serial Port.

### Serial Port
- Full-duplex UART with programmable baud rate generator.

### I/O Ports
- Four 8-bit I/O ports (Port 0, Port 1, Port 2, Port 3).

### Oscillator and Clock
- Requires an external crystal oscillator for clock generation.

## Instruction Set
- Includes a rich set of instructions for data movement, arithmetic, logic, branching, and I/O operations.

## Modes of Operation
- Four operating modes: 
  - 0: Idle mode
  - 1: Power-down mode
  - 2: External memory access mode
  - 3: Normal operating mode
